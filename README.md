## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:
I think i should get a 19/20, I worked fairly hard on this project though I deducted on point since it's the bare minimum with no flashy substance to it. Also part of my github commits are missing since I wanted to delete the old repo to get a fresh mindset but I don't think that should deduct points.

## Self-Reflection:
  This one took me a bit, mainly because I worked on it, then relaizsed that something was wrong so this whole assigment was like starting in the middle and then going back and forth with what I needed to fix. At least I got it all done though.

### How long it took me to finish this?
5 hours maybe, I did spend about a hour trying to get the fillrect functions in the right space since it took me a while to understand how much a number affects it, and then I had to relearn that while it was rotated.
